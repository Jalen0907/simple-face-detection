📷 Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV
A simple real-time face detection project using OpenCV and Haar cascade classifiers. The script captures video from the webcam and detects faces using pre-trained models.

🚀 Features
✅ Uses Haar cascades for efficient face detection
✅ Captures real-time video using OpenCV
✅ Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
✅ Press 'q' to exit

📌 Installation
1️⃣ Install dependencies:


pip install opencv-python numpy
2️⃣ Download the Haar cascade classifier for face detection:


get https://github.com/opencv/opencv/raw/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
🛠️ Usage
Run the script:

python face_detection.py
⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a basic example for educational purposes. It may not work well in all lighting conditions or with different face angles.
